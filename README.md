Developed a compiler for a basic Attribute Grammar. This language transforms written code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and performs comprehensive syntactic and semantic error checks, including type checking and declaration validation. The compiler conducts abstract analysis and incorporates code optimization techniques to enhance the overall efficiency of the generated code.
According to my School's guidelines, I cannot make the actual repository public, but can definitely show you a working compiler! So do let me know if this interests you!
